# Desk width calculator

I was trying to see how wide my desk needs to be to fit 3 monitors on it and decided to build the equations for it myself. here they are in a python notebook if it ever helps anyone :3

## Note

The equation calculated the desk width needed to have the entire monitor above the table. the current version does use the size of the monitor stand to optimize the minimal desk width further.
